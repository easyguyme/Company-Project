## Issue Management

* **Summary**: 
 * Better to indicate the component in of the issue, suggested format [Component Name] Issue summary.  [Component] is desired but not required.
* **Labels**: 
 * Always contain a _first label_ to indicate the type of the issue:
   * epic: Usually entered by a product manager, describing a relatively big business need, indicating a direction of product progression and set expectations to development mange  Epics need be further break down to stories as input to designers, developers and QAs. 
   * story: mostly entered by product team, describing the "requirement" for user point of view. Designer provide interaction & visual design and  QAs develop test cases based on stories. 
   * task: mostly entered by delivery manage or tech leads. In the case that they are implementation breakdowns of stories, add [story-ID] as the prefix of its summary. Unless specifically asked by developer,  QA will not test such issues.
   * bug: bugs found on implemented functions
   * tbd: open items to be discussed or determined
* **Milestones**:
 * Treat milestones are Bus Stops. How many passengers get on the bus on each stop can be determined, but bus will always arrive and leave on time, NO DELAYs.  Milestone time need be well communicated to every team member.  They need feel high pressure when a milestone is coming.
 * All issues shall be assigned to a milestone.  A ambiguous milestone - Feature Release - can used as product backlog
* **Description**:
 * Description of a story contains: value/objective; actor; steps; result;
* **Priorities**:
 * P1/P2 are MUST-COMPLETE within the defined timeframe, following the order.
 * P3 is SOLUTION-REQUIRED (may not reach a competition, but design, plan, estimates etc. need be provided within the defined timeframe)
 * P4 is trivial, can be pushed to next milestone or feature releases.
 * Don't use P5
 * Product Manager and Delivery Manager need seat down together to set the priorities before a milestone is started.
 * Product Manager need review bug priorities regularly.
* **Assignee**:
 * All the issues in the current milestone and the coming milestone need have an assignee.

On top of everything,  all the work need be reflected in the issues.
